## Atom.io Settings 

Atom is an open source text editor built as a desktop application based on web technologies. It has all your native menus and dialogs, and full access to the file system. What makes it different than say Sublime then? The power of the opensource community. As part of the GitHub team (when Atom was relased) I had the pleasure of designing many of the first version elements.
